# CleanFlutter
A Flutter project with Clean Architecture. **For the link of the project presentation, click [here](https://prezi.com/view/XNsm2gaEECR1xur67XOV/).**

# Introduction

It's a layered and domain-centric architecture.  

With the following advantages:

* Structuring
* Decoupling
* Testable
* Independence

## Dependency Rule

This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards.

# Layers

## Domain
The `Domain` layer defines the business logic of the application.
* Core :  The main classes that are used in the `Domain` layer.
* Entities : Enterprise wide business rules.
* UseCases : Application specific business rules.
* Repositories : Abstract classes that define the expected functionality of outer layers.

```flutter
cd clean_project/layers/domain
```

## Data
The `Data` layer is responsible for data retrieval.
* Repositories : Concrete classes that implement the repository from the domain layer.
* ExternalData : Data source(Rest Api, Firebase , Device).

```flutter
cd clean_project/layers/data
```

## Presentation
The `Presentation` layer is the representation of the application.
* Configuration : Initial settings of the `Presentation` layer (Navigation, Initialization).
* Screens : Represents the user interface, events, and lifecycle.
```flutter
cd clean_project/layers/presentation

or

cd clean_project/layers/getx_presentation
```

## App
The `App` layer contains all the general app configurations(Platform(IOS,Android), Dependency Injection, Run App).
```flutter
cd clean_project/lib
```

# Installation

Install [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to run the project.

Run the following commands

```flutter
cd clean_project

flutter pub get
```

# Run
```flutter
flutter run
```
## Run with GetX
```flutter
WITH_GETX=true
```

```flutter
flutter run
```

## Run Test
```flutter
flutter test --coverage
```
